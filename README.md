HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO PARTICIPATE AND COMPLETE HACKTOBERFEST:
- Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
- Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
- The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes:
a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
- Always make more then 4 pull request
lets you have made only 4 pull request to different projects
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be count and 
then you have remains 3 valid pull request if these projects is not excluded.
if you fail to make 4 pull request then you cant get swags or t-shirts.
i will recommend you make pull request to your own repo which is very very saffest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
